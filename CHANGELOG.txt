SPARTAN Version 3.10.0
======================================================================

GETTRACES:
* Remove support for MetaMorph .stk files due to licensing concerns with tiffread.m.
* Add "subtract baseline trace" option to suppress "flagging" effect with very high FRET traces.
* Sample 10% of pixels for baseline trace due reduce computational demand.
* Apply ROI selection only after detecting overlapping molecules.

AUTOTRACE:
* Show a warning instead of an error if Curve Fitting Toolbox is unavailable when using maxTotalSigma criteria.

MAKEPLOTS:
* Add "normalize to max" contour plot option to settings dialog.

HMM:
* Deprecate support for QuB model files (.qmf) and remove source code to address licensing concerns. Will be removed completely before public release.
* dyediag: top (lines) and bottom (bars) rows have corresponding plots to avoid confusion.

OTHER:
* Movie version number from cascadeConstants.m to VERSION.txt. This solves the problem of user-modified configuration being clobbered by version updates.
* Add LICENSE.txt with copyright notices and license terms.
* Change website link for SPARTAN update dialog to the GitHub.
