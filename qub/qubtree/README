The code in this directory is derived from the freely-available source code for
the QuB software suite for ion channel recordings. Only a minimal set of files
is included that are necessary for loading and saving QuB-format files. The
version used was 1.5.0.15.

To compile the library, run make (Linux/Unix/MacOSX) or use the Visual Studio
project files for Winodws. For *nix systems, only the static library is used.
