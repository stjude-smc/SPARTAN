The C/C++ files in this directory are for compiling MEX functions for loading
and saving QuB files -- specifically .qmf model files. To recompile the MEX
files, you will need to first compile the qubtree library in the qubtree
directory a Makefile and Visual Studio project files are there for compiling on
Linux/Unix/MacOSX and Windows, respectively. Once this is done, run 
qub_compile_mex.m from within matlab in this directory. The new MEX files will
be placed in the "binary" directory.
